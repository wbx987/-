# 基于个性化分类器的联邦学习算法研究
客户端之间的数据异质性是联邦学习面临的核心挑战之一。这种异质性的存在使传统的联邦平均算法（FedAvg）性能显著下降，无法达到理想效果。在此背景下，个性化联邦学习应运而生，旨在通过个性化学习策略提升算法性能。本文首先复现了经典的FedAvg算法，并在此基础上，通过引入“基础层+个性化层”的模型划分策略，复现了基于个性化分类器的联邦学习算法FedPer。该算法通过共享基础层和保留个性化层的方法，以适应客户端本地数据分布。实验结果表明，在数据高度异质环境下，FedPer算法展现出卓越的鲁棒性和稳定性，其测试准确率明显优于FedAvg，且收敛速度更快。特别是在图像复杂度更高的CIFAR-10数据集上，即使在数据极端异质的条件下，FedPer依然能够保持显著的领先优势。相比之下，FedAvg算法对数据异质性极为敏感，其性能随数据异质程度的增加而明显下降。本文的发现印证了基于个性化分类器的联邦学习算法FedPer相比于FedAvg在应对数据异质性时的优越性。

Data heterogeneity between clients is one of the core challenges of federated learning. The existence of such heterogeneity significantly degrades the performance of the traditional federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg), which cannot achieve the desired results. In this context, personalized federated learning emerges, aiming to improve the algorithm performance through personalized learning strategies. In this thesis, we first reproduce the classical FedAvg algorithm, and based on this, we reproduce FedPer, a federated learning algorithm based on personalized classifiers, by introducing a model partitioning strategy of “base layer + personalized layer”, which adapts to the client's local data distribution by sharing the base layer and retaining the personalized layer. The algorithm is designed to adapt to the local data distribution of the client. Experimental results show that the FedPer algorithm exhibits excellent robustness and stability in highly heterogeneous data environments, and its test accuracy is significantly better than that of FedAvg with faster convergence. Especially on the CIFAR-10 dataset with higher image complexity, FedPer is still able to maintain a significant lead even under the condition of extreme data heterogeneity. In contrast, the FedAvg algorithm is extremely sensitive to data heterogeneity, and its performance decreases significantly with increasing data heterogeneity. The findings in this thesis corroborate the superiority of FedPer, a federated learning algorithm based on personalized classifiers, over FedAvg in dealing with data heterogeneity.
